    This email is purely advisory, and does not serve as an official notice for the anticipatory action framework. Official notices of activation are sent by a separate email. This email also does not constitute an official forecast. Under the World Meteorological Organization's Tropical Cyclone Programme, RSMC Nadi is responsible for monitoring tropical cyclones in the region, and their proper publications should be treated as authoritative.

  <p>Dear colleagues,</p>
  <p>
    The forecast for cyclone {{ name }} produced at {{ pub_time }} (UTC) on {{ pub_date }} has been shared with us by the Fiji Meteorological Service, operators of Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) Nadi.

    Readiness trigger: <b>{{ readiness }}</b><br>
    Action trigger: <b>{{ action }}</b>
  </p>

    A plot of the forecast is shown below. Due to the increased uncertainty of forecasting tropical cyclones beyond 72 hours, this portion of the forecast should be treated with caution.

    The plot below shows the distance of each Province to the forecasted cyclone path, including the approximate uncertainty of the cyclone's path at its closest pass to the Province. This data is also included in the attached CSV.
